# crux-psi-api-batch
1. Both Python scripts are for Google Colab
2. Scripts fetch sitemap, query CrUX database / PSI tool and export results as CSV
3. Export contains: url, CWV test status (failed/passed), metric status (poor/needs improvement/good) for lcp, cls, fcp, ttfb 
4. Script for PSI is optimized for speed (60 queries / 100 seconds)
